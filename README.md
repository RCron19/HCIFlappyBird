# HCIFlappyBird  
HCI Group Project Repo  
M1: Added base flappy bird implementation using clicks to flap.  
M2: Improvements to the general structure and attemps at adding voice controls.  
M3: Voice controls added, switched from WebGL to Windows EXE build due to Unity dropping microphone support for WebGL  
M4: Flight controls polished to be continuous movements rather than instances of static force, polished game further.
